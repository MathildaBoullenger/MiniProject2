# MiniProject2

Purpose: 
Connects the user with other runners in their area based on location and gender filter.

Main code: 
We broke down the structure into components - components for each element of the page as well as three components representing each page. 
We use context to share the input data amongst all components. 
the runners are fetched from an own api in the backend. 

There is unused code for 'running' distance and also a hook that captures the start time fot the implementation of future features. 

Credits: 
We used Express for the backend
React for thr frontend 
MUI as a CDN
